        <p> &emsp; My name is Peter McAughan and this is my personal website. I'm going to organize this information into categories so it's easier for you to navigate.</p>
        <h2 align="center"> Myself </h2>
        <p> &emsp; I'm currently a student at Texas A&M University, where I plan to graduate in May 2018 with a bachelor's in Computer Engineering. I'm 21 years old, and I've lived in Houston my whole life. I attended high school at
            <a href="http://www.strakejesuit.org">Strake Jesuit</a> to graduate in 2014, and moved onto college later that year. I'm involved as an officer in KANM, the student radio station at A&M,
        and I hold an on-campus job performing IT services for the Chemistry Department. As the time of writing this, I'm interning as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://detechtion.com/">Detechtion Technologies</a> for my summer before senior year,
        and I'm loving my time here!
        <h2 align="center"> This Site </h2>
        <p> &emsp; This is my first attempt at learning HTML/CSS and website design, so bear with me if some things look a bit funky. This site uses some fancy jQuery for animations, and hopefully
        I'll be able to get some games running with phaser.io, a Javascript game engine for webpages. Other than that, everything on this site was handled by me (shoutouts to w3schools.com!). Besides having a place to
            express who I am, I want to do some other cool things while I have a site. Sharing music was a big function that I was interested in, and as an extension sharing anything I'm interested in. I'm also trying to
            program some games into the site, but really that's a side goal that comes after having everything else in a functional state.
        </p>
        <h2 align="center"> Future Plans </h2>
        <p> &emsp; I'm currently working an 8 hour workday and I'll be going back to school in the fall so I don't have a lot of free time to work on this site, but I'd like to use this to share my interests.
        This means constantly updating my music page as well as my interests page.</p>
