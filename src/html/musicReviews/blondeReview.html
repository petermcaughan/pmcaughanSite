        <p class='text' style="font-size:1.1vw;">To be honest, I had no idea what to think about Blonde the first time I heard it. It's radically different than Frank Ocean's other works, and I can't say its as easily accessible. </br>
            What I can say, though, is that once you begin to like this album, that feeling will only grow as you listen to it more and more. While the album feels minimalist, there's incredible depth to every song, and you can find something
            new you haven't noticed before in every listen. <br/>
            It's hard for me to really describe what I feel in this album. If you find yourself in the mood to sit down and devote some time to explore new music, I would recommend this album above all else.
