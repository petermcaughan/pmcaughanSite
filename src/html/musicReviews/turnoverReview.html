            &emsp; I find that this album is exceptional in conveying the idea "Everything is awful, but that's alright." The lyrics and instrumentals are going in opposite directions the entire album, and depending on which one you focus on the feel of the entire album can
            drastically change. </br>
            Every song depicts some kind of struggle, from growing older and leaving youth to break-ups and emotional isolation, but you'll find the tempo and instrumentals to be light-hearted and relaxed. I personally like to focus on the brighter side and believe
            that Turnover is telling us that behind our hardships, there's positivity playing in the background.
