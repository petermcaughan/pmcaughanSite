            Woman really stands out to me because everything about it is so aesthetically sensual. The instrumentals, beat patterns, and vocals pull you in to focus on pure emotion.
            This album isn't a musical statement you have to think deeply about, but the sweeping feelings that come when you stop focusing are what make this album for me. 'Major Minor Love'
            and '3 Days' are my highlights.
