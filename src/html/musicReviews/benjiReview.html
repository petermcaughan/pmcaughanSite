        <p class='text'>Benji is, above all else, a down-to-earth album. Along beautiful melodies and instrumentals, Sun Kil Moon doesn't try to make any big statements in his music, he doesn't try to romanticize himself or anyone else. </br>
            All he does is tell a series of experiences he's had throughout his life so vividly that you feel like you've known him for years. Because of this, I feel this album is so incredibly genuine, and that's what makes it stand out so much to me. I'd highly recommend listening to Micheline, Carissa, and Ben's My Friend to get a feel for the album.
