            Jack Johnson is a very popular artist with millions of listens on this album in particular. What makes his music popular, I think, isn't his reputation or collection of catchy beats, but the mood he produces with every song. <br/>
            Every track on this album makes me feel like all the dust has settled in my life and all is right in the world. I've been exposed to this album since it was released in 2005, and no matter what I'm going through it's never failed to take me to a sunny beach somewhere.
            I highly recommend listening to If I Could and Do You Remember in particular, I feel these tracks highlight the reason Jack Johnson is the
            definition of 'feel good music' to me.
