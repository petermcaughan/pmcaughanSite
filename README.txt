EDIT: Most everything works!! Still working on the "News" section and I don't have a ton of time to get that sorted out, but patience is a virtue :^) plan to be adding music albums regularly but nothing big is on the plate for a while.


This is the source code for my site as of 7/7/2017. At the moment, it's in a functional state but there are quite a few things I'd like to optimize and add.
The files included in the site are found under src, and most everything in this root directory is wamp server default files, which I haven't touched.
