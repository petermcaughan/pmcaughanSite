    <div class="experience-details" style="font-size: .85vw;">
        <p> I worked in an agile environment with a team of 8-9 developers for around 3 months. Along with various bug fixes, I was assigned to two major projects: </p>
        <p> Porting a major product from iOS to Android. This involved using various open-source software packages including Apache Cordova to make the transition, as well as handling the release of
        the application on the Google Play Store. Organizing in-office testing among co-workers and beta testing with customers was my responsibility, as well as creating and decorating the company's Google Play account. </p>
        <p> Creating a sales demo for presentation to potential customers for analytical software. I was responsible for manipulating data in a SQL database to create an environment where customers could see how their
        data would appear in an analytic dashboard. Understanding how to create a large amount of realistic, "real-time" data in the most efficient way was a big challenge in this project. </p>

        <h2>Station Engineer</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="experience-details" style="font-size:1vw;">
       <p> Worked as the tech lead in the student-run radio station of Texas A&M. Technical responsibilities include maintaining database of music to be played, handling automatic DJ playing during non-broadcast hours,
        helping develop the kanm.org website, and handle all hardware issues that arise. Communicating the status of all these responsibilities to non-technical members of the station is a big part of this role.</p>
        <p> In addition to the officer position, I also have a weekly radio show where I organize and play setlists as well as talk about music, current issues, or anything that I want, really. For just about three years now
        I've gone on air and talked into a microphone for an hour, which has improved my speaking skills considerably.</p>
