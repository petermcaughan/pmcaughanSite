        <p> &emsp; My name is Peter McAughan and this is my personal website. I'm going to organize this information into categories so it's easier for you to navigate.</p>
        <h2 align="center"> Myself </h2>
        <p> &emsp; I'm currently a student at Texas A&M University, where I plan to graduate in May 2018 with a bachelor's in Computer Engineering and minors in Cybersecurity and Math. I'm 22 years old, and I've lived in Houston my whole life. I attended high school at
            <a href="http://www.strakejesuit.org">Strake Jesuit</a> to graduate in 2014, and moved onto college later that year. I'm involved as an officer in KANM, the student radio station at A&M,
        and I held an on-campus job performing IT services for the Chemistry Department. In the summer of 2017 I interned as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://detechtion.com/">Detechtion Technologies</a>, and I'm currently looking for summer internships in software development before I start school at Georgia Tech in the Fall.
        <p>
            My interests I are centered around cybersecurity and computing systems, but I'm also greatly interested in HCI work. Designing software systems while holding the mindset of a malicious adversary is definitely exciting and leads to a much more thoughtful design process, and similarly designing software systems under the mindset of a typical user also changes the way you think! I'm currently searching for internships in these areas and beyond.

        <h2 align="center"> This Site </h2>
        <p> &emsp; This is my first attempt at learning HTML/CSS and website design, so bear with me if some things look a bit funky. This site uses some fancy jQuery for animations, and hopefully
        I'll be able to get some games running with phaser.io, a Javascript game engine for webpages. Other than that, everything on this site was handled by me (shoutouts to w3schools.com!). Besides having a place to
            express who I am, I want to do some other cool things while I have a site. Sharing music was a big function that I was interested in, and as an extension sharing anything I feel describes myself in some way. I'm also trying to
            put some games and news into the site, but really that's a side goal that comes after having everything else in a functional state.
        </p>
        <h2 align="center"> Future Plans </h2>
        <p> &emsp; School's back in session so I'll be working on this site a whole lot less unfortunately.</p>
        <p> &emsp; I'd like to make something of the page that I have under construction. In addition to that, the games I've put into the page are pretty simple examples from the engine site, and I'd like to at least have one more complex game that I've created or imported from a good source. I could try and
        put in the game that I've created in my Projects page, but I need to look more into how Amazon handles its server and maybe rewrite some server code from our game. </p>
