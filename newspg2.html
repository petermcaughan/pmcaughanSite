            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Sensory Substitution and the Human-Machine Interface; Bach-y-Rita 2003 </h1>
            <p>
                In one of the Georgia Tech Ubicomp Lab meetings Dr. Abowd claimed that if you're writing an academic paper, you want to either be the first or the last written about a particular subject. This paper is one of the first influential
                reviews written about sensory substitution, and therefore holds a lot of influence over how the field has developed over the past 15 years. Sensory substitution is a field of human-computer interaction that is focused on the plasticity, or ability to adapt, of the brain. For those that are born without a sense or have one forced from them,
                information about the surrounding world or actuation to it can be lost. The blind cannot use light to perceive, and the deaf cannot use most sound to perceive. What if we used technology to let these people receive this information? Instead of approaching this issue
                from a surgical perspective, we can design non-obtrusive wearable devices to simply communicate this sensory information using the other functional senses. For example, visual information regarding color, depth, and intensity of light can be
                delivered to the blind through audio signals. This may seem completely unintuitive, and raises the question of how can these users possibly interpret this data in a meaningful, practical way? This is where brain plasticity comes in. The brain can
                interpret these signals over time and adapt its neurochemical, synaptic, and receptor structures so that the user will subconsciously be able to perceive information without consciously analyzing the incoming signals. Incredible! Just as you could look at a car and perceive 'red'
                without consciously analyzing the frequency of photons, so too can an adapted brain perceive 'red' through audio without consciously analyzing the signals. This paper claims that technology has developed to a point where these systems are
                absolutely practical and can ready to be deployed to the general population given an effort to do so (this was in 2003!). Additionally, this paper describes the future three-pronged direction of this field. Firstly, make these systems more robust and inexpensive so they can be deployed large-scale.
                Secondly, explore the use of this technology not to replace lost senses for the disabled, but enhance sensory capabilities of everyone. Imagine being able to subconsciously sense magnetic fields, ultraviolet light, or any other interesting phenomena! Thirdly,
                this field serves as a great opportunity for us to learn more about the brain itself, and observing how the brain reacts to new input is an important gateway to knowledge in neuroscience fields.

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Depression in the US: The Numbers</h1>
            <p> The National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency under the CDC dedicated to studying population health trends, publishes about 2-3 data briefings every month concerning health issues in the United States. From weight loss to infant mortality rates, these briefings cover a wide variety of topics, are relatively short, and contain to-the-point data figures and analyses. I strongly recommend going through their webpage and finding subjects you're interested in; I've found they're a great way to get acquainted with problems that a certain population or demographic face. There's one collective issue that's written about a lot, with many briefings covering it. One such briefing is titled <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db07.htm">'Depression in the United States Household Population 2005-2006'</a>, and there are three takeaways I have from this. Firstly and intuitively, Americans who fall underneath the poverty line have <i>vastly</i> increased rates of depression. Starting at 12 years old, any person in poverty is on average <i>four times</i> as likely to have depression. Furthermore, 80% of all people who report being depressed describe tangible, functional impairment in their lives due to their condition. Finally, the vast majority (around 80%) of these people did not see a professional for treatment. All of these data points probably don't surprise you, but it's important to have these observations in mind as tangible facts regardless. Two years after this briefing was published, the Department of Health and Human Services launched a program named Healthy People 2020, a plan to accomplish 1,200 health objectives using measurable data and baseline targets. One of these efforts is to combat the prevalence of depression and reduce the occurance of suicide in the United States, but another briefing released in June 2018 showed that the results aren't going as expected. I'm not claiming that the 'Healthy People 2020' initiative has totally failed, as I really don't know too much about it. What is factual, however, is that the goal was to reduce suicide rates from 11.3 (per 100,000) in 2007 to 10.2 by 2020. Currently, at the end of 2018, the suicide rate is 13.5 and climbing slowly but steadily. These trends are marked by a recently published briefing titled <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db309.pdf">Suicide Rates in the US Continue to Increase"</a>. Some notable statistics are the observation that females experience depression at about double the rate of males, but males commit suicide at a rate about 2.5x that of females. Additionally, the means of suicide differ significantly between sexes, but that's not too important to this underlying message. Personally, I think we've made a lot of great strides in socially recognizing mental health as a serious issue in our country but we obviously still have a long way to go. The facts show that bringing more people above the poverty line will absolutely lower rates of depression and suicide, with the apparent 'sweet spot' at a household income 4x the poverty line. Additionally, combining early detection procedures with normalizing treatment will help lower the number of untreated individuals. These solutions are pretty hard to implement in reality however. I can't think of a great, practical way to help remedy this problem using technology, but I think an answer is out there somewhere. Scientists and engineers have an ethical duty to solve the problems of society, and this is a huge (and growing) tragedy.

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">See Though Walls with Wi-Fi; Dina Katabi 2013</h1>
            This is absolutely fascinating! I was lucky enough to attend a talk by Dina Katabi, a professor at MIT, about the different utilizations of wi-fi and RF signals all around us and it was incredible to hear about their accomplishments.
                The linked paper is actually a thesis, so it's quite a read but definitely worth it! By utilizing signal receivers and transmitters, this team was able to accomplish real-time localization and tracking of numerous
            moving bodies <i> through walls </i>. With absolutely no visual components, the proposed technology can track even human poses; where your hands, head, and feet are at a given moment in time. This is accomplished using
            quite a lot of interesting signal processing and machine learning techniques described in the source link. There are many applications of this, but activity recognition was a focus. Now, without installing obtrusive tracking
            hardware into a home environment, indoor activity of disabled individuals, Alzheimer's patients, and schizophrenics can be analyzed more accurately and wholly than ever before. Taking it one step further, if this technology is installed near
            a bed, it can utilize the signal reflections of your brain to determine what stage of a sleep cycle you're in. Currently, this can only be accomplished with an <a href="https://cdn.bio-medical.com/media/catalog/product/cache/image/700x700/e9c3970ab036de70892d86c6d221abfe/e/l/electro-cap_large_blue_cap_58-62cm_ref_pin_13_cpz_with_2_eog_electrodes_ear_slits_25_pin_connector-acec100606-false-777.jpg"> EKG headset </a>
            which is uncomfortable to sleep in and thus making it harder to collect natural sleeping data. By analyzing sleep data over a period of time, it's entirely possible to diagnose mental disorders such as Alzheimer's or depression and provide the
            early detection that is necessary for good treatment. There are so many ways this technology can be implemented, and I strongly encourage you to watch the video or read the paper to see how amazing it is!</p>
