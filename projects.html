	Brailler is a Braille printing system designed to be easily used by the blind and non-impaired. The integrated microphone uses Google Speech API to recognize voice, produce a text translation, and send this data to a Raspberry Pi controller. The Pi is wired to a repurposed CNC machine, and using PyCNC libraries it can convert text into motor controls that allow the CNC to print Braille on paper. Additionally, the on-board interface allows for selection of image, PDF, and text files. PyTesseract libraries allow for image-to-text translation, and can feed its output into the Pi as well.
    Created as part of my senior capstone project at Texas A&M.<p>

    BerrySafe is a home security system using a Raspberry Pi, Arduino sensors, and an integrated Android application. After setting up motion sensors, cameras, and door sensors around a house, the Raspberry Pi can constantly read sensor data and relay it to the user via the mobile application. The user can 'lock' or 'unlock' the system from anywhere, and when the system is locked the Pi will trigger an alarm if motion is sensed or a door is opened. Additionally, the Pi captures and stores photos constantly to record a timeframe of activity in a room, and a user can request the most recently photo be displayed on their phone at any time.<p>

    This was a really fun project created with my little brother at Texas A&M's 2018 Hackathon, which was a great experience. MyMuseum is a content-sharing website that was intended as a place to share data about your experiences and sentimental posessions. The user can customize a page dedicated to a certain memory or object, and upload text, audio, video, or images related to it. The site then generates a QR code linking to your page, and you can share it with anyone that has the code. However, the site can be used generally to share content through a QR code for any reason. The backend was created using the EC2 service on AWS, and having a mySQL database that interacted through the webpage with PHP. Some challenges were securely storing user information and making sure that you could access a user's page only through a certain url with PHP arguments coded in the QR code.</p>
